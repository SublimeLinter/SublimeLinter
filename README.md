## Installation 

Install SublimeLinter and linters via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/search/SublimeLinter). 

## Settings

Settings are mostly documented in the [default settings](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/blob/master/SublimeLinter.sublime-settings). When you open the SublimeLinter settings you'll see them on the left.

- Additional information is in our docs at [sublimelinter.com](http://sublimelinter.com/).
- Read about all the changes between 3 and 4 [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/master/messages/4.0.0.txt). 

## Quick Actions (beta)

We're building a new feature called Quick Actions, that will allow you to quickly ignore specific error messages. At first SublimeLinter will ship actions for [eslint](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-eslint), [stylelint](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-stylelint), [flake8](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-flake8), [mypy](https://github.com/fredcallaway/SublimeLinter-contrib-mypy) and [phpcs](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-phpcs).

Want to see actions for your favourite linter? Please open a PR with your addition to [quick_fix.py](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/blob/master/lint/quick_fix.py). We have some [tests](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/tree/master/tests) you can add to as well. 

Eventually, as this feature becomes more stable, we will expose it as an API so that plugins can add their own actions.

## Key Bindings
