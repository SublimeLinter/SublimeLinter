## About SublimeLinter
A framework for interactive code linting in the [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3) editor. The Sublime Text 2 version is no longer being supported; you can find it [here](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter).

**Documentation:** See it on [readthedocs.org](https://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org).

**Support & Bugs:** Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/issues) to report installation and configuration problems. If you think you have found a bug, please search for it on the deprecated [SublimeLinter google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sublimelinter) first, and if it can't be found you can report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/issues). Please be sure to put your OS, SublimeLinter version, and **ENTIRE** debug console output in the issue. If your issue is specific to a particular linter, please report it on that linter's repository instead.

**Contributing:** If you would like to submit a fix or enhancement for SublimeLinter, please read the [contributing guidelines](https://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html) first.

## Key Bindings

SublimeLinter comes with several pre-defined keyboard shortcuts. You can customize these via the Package Settings menu\*. Read more about keybindings in [the unofficial documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/customization/key_bindings.html)

| Command         | Linux & Windows  | MacOS                  |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Lint            | CTRL + K, L      | CTRL + CMD + L         |
| Next Error      | CTRL + K, N      | CTRL + CMD + E         |
| Prev. Error     | CTRL + K, P      | CTRL + CMD + SHIFT + E |
| Show All Errors | CTRL + K, A      | CTRL + CMD + A         |
| Toggle Linter   | CTRL + K, T      | CTRL + CMD + T         |

\*) Other packages might override these key bindings, and they could override those defined by others. Your personal keybindings have the final say over what binding does what, so edit these if something doesn't work as you expect.
