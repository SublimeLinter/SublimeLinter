Creating a gutter theme
=======================

Use one of the existing gutter themes as a starting point: https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/tree/master/gutter-themes.

To colorize icons the .gutter-theme file should contain: `{ "colorize": true }`.
In this case your icons should be mostly white, with shades of gray to create shadow areas.

Gutter images are scaled to to 16 x 16. For best results with Retina displays, gutter images should be 32 x 32.

To install your theme place the directory in Packages/User.
