Creating a gutter theme
=======================

Use one of the existing gutter themes as a starting point.
You can find them in the repo_.

To colorize icons the .gutter-theme file should contain:
``{ "colorize": true }``.
In this case your icons should be mostly white, with shades of gray to create shadow areas.

Gutter images are scaled to to 16 x 16.
For best results with Retina displays, gutter images should be 32 x 32.

To install your theme place the directory in Packages/User.
