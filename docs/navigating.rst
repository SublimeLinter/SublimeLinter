Navigating Errors
==================
If errors occur during linting, there are several ways available to quickly navigate through them. There are three commands for navigating errors: ``Next Error``, ``Previous Error``, and ``Show All Errors``.

.. note::

   These commands do **not** lint the current view, they only navigate. If your :doc:`lint mode <lint_modes>` is not **background**, you will have :ref:`manually lint <manually-linting>` if you want to see the lint errors for the current state of the file.


Accessing navigation commands
-----------------------------
You can access these commands in several ways.

**Command Palette**
:raw-html:`<br>`
Bring up the |_cmd| and type :kbd:`next`, :kbd:`previous`, or :kbd:`show`. Among the commands you should see ``SublimeLinter: Next Error``, ``SublimeLinter: Previous Error``, or ``SublimeLinter: Show All Errors``. If the command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

**Context menu**
:raw-html:`<br>`
If you right-click (or Control-click on OS X) within a file view, you will see a ``SublimeLinter`` submenu at the bottom of the context menu. Select ``SublimeLinter > Next Error``, ``SublimeLinter > Previous Error``, or ``SublimeLinter > Show All Errors``.

**Keyboard**
:raw-html:`<br>`
You can also use the keyboard to access the navigation commands.

=============== ======================= ====================
Command         Mac OS X                Linux/Windows
=============== ======================= ====================
Next Error      Command+Control+E       Control+K, n
Previous Error  Command+Control+Shift+E Control+K, p
Show All Errors Command+Control+A       Control+K, a
=============== ======================= ====================

If there are any errors in the current view, the next/previous error will be selected, or all errors will be displayed in a Quick Panel. If there are no errors, an alert will appear which indicates there are no errors.


.. _showing-all-errors:

Showing all errors
------------------
When you select the ``Show All Errors`` command, all errors in the view are displayed in a Quick Panel. Each item displays the line number and error message on the first line, and the source code on the second line:

.. image:: images/show-all-errors.png

Note that a âžœ is inserted in the source code at the position where the error occurs.

Selecting an error and typing :kbd:`Return/Enter` or clicking on an error navigates directly to that error.
