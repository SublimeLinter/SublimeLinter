    Lint the given view.

    This is the top level lint dispatcher. It is called
    asynchronously. The following checks are done for each linter
    assigned to the view:

    - Check if the linter has been disabled in settings.
    - Check if the filename matches any patterns in the "excludes" setting.

    If a linter fails the checks, it is disabled for this run.
    Otherwise, if the mapped syntax is not in the linter's selectors,
    the linter is run on the entirety of code.

    Then the set of selectors for all linters assigned to the view is
    aggregated, and for each selector, if it occurs in sections,
    the corresponding section is linted as embedded code.
