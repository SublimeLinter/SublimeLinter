SublimeLinter 3.10.8
---------------------

Added a "use_current_shell_path" preference that basically does what is says :)

---------------------

SublimeLinter 4 now in beta!

Read about it here:
https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/blob/next/messages/4.0.0-rc.1.txt

Participate by editing your Package Control preferences and adding
SublimeLinter to the "install_prereleases" key:

"install_prereleases":
[
  "SublimeLinter"
]

If you want to use SublimeLinter-flake8 during the beta, you need to add it to
the "install_prereleases" as well.
Most other linter plugins should be compatible.
