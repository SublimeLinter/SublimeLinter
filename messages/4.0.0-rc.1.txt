SublimeLinter 4.0.0 Pre-Release
===============================

New features
-------------------------------

- Hover over an error to view the message.
- Hover over the gutter to view all error messages for that line.
- The statusbar now shows error (E) and warning (W) counts if there are any.
- The statusbar shows the error for your cursor position instead of all errors
  for that line.
- A new "styles" setting to configure error highlighting.
- Each linter setting now accepts such a "styles" setting, so colors and
  highlight style can be differentiated per linter.
- Styles also have a "priority" which decides what color to show in the gutter.
- Gutter themes can now be set using just their name.
- Generated "(SL)" color schemes are now hidden.

On Sublime Text 3 builds > 3149 (dev builds):
- No "(SL)" color scheme files are generated.
- Select a color by specifying "region.<colorish>" in the scope option. Colors:
  redish, orangish, yellowish, greenish, bluish, purplish, pinkish
- It's also possible to use any other color by specifying any scope that's in
  your color scheme (e.g. "entity.name")


Changes to commands and menus
-------------------------------

The context menu now only list commands relevant for the view context.
The tools menu now only lists the clear_cache command.
Commands are now named sublime_linter_* to comply with naming conventions.

Commands to change settings or toggle linters have been removed.
- Settings can be changed by modifying your user settings.
- Linters may be disabled in the user settings, in .sublimelinterrc files, or
  in your project configuration. Or you can disable each specific plugin.


Changes to settings
-------------------------------

Default settings now have documentation inline.
Default settings are no longer copied to the user settings.
- Learn about the configuration options for each linter in the docs and
  in the README of the linter plugin.

The "user" node has been removed from settings.

The settings "ignore_matches" and "demote_to_warning_matches" have been removed.
Your linter should have settings to modify the rules or severity levels.

The setting make_warnings_passive has been removed. The new reporting features
should make this an unnecesary feature.


How to upgrade
-------------------------------

To salvage your custom settings:
- The "user: {" node should have been removed automatically
- You can keep the "linters" block
- Check each remaining setting against the defaults and remove what's the same
  or doesn't exist in the defaults
