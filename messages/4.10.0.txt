SublimeLinter 4.10.0
====================

Improved panel view

- More tabular layout (automatic column widths)
- Files are sorted (yay!) 
- Highlight error if the cursor is nearby (before: if the cursor is on an error)
- Show a viewport marker if the file has lots of errors
- Improved scrolling so that the current file is always shown at the top of the panel
- Improved syntax highlighting: The header line conatining the filename can be styled using `output.sublime_linter meta.error_panel.fileline.sublime_linter`
- Wrap long error messages

Backend

- We introduced `LintMatch` which makes esp. JSON reporters way more readable
- We support `error_type` (aka severity), `code` (aka rule name), and `filename` in the regexes (and via `LintMatch` for JSON reporters)
- `error_type` is not restricted to 'warning/error' anymore
- A linter can report errors coming from multiple files. We currently keep errors from open files. We throw away errors from files without a view automatically. @mheinzler contributed this!

Note: We actually shipped the new `LintMatch` silently a few weeks ago to see if it breaks.
