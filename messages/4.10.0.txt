SublimeLinter 4.10.0
====================

New setting: highlights.start_hidden
Enabling this setting will hide all highlights until you explicitly Toggle Highlights.
Thanks to @AndrewMast for this! ðŸŽ‰ (See #1576)


Improved functionality of the disable_if_not_dependency setting.


Improved panel view:
- Tabular layout (automatic column widths)
- Files are sorted (yay!)
- Highlight error if the cursor is nearby (before the cursor had to be _on_ an error)
- New viewport markers indicate which errors are inside the current viewport
- Scrolls so that the current file is always at the top of the panel
- Improved scopes for syntax highlighting
- Long error messages now wrap


For linter plugin authors:
- New `LintMatch` to make esp. JSON reporters way more readable
- Support for `error_type` (aka severity), `code` (aka rule name), and `filename` in the regexes (and via `LintMatch` for JSON reporters)
- Severity is no longer restricted to 'warning/error', e.g. so you can report 'info' level feedback
- We claim the keys `end_line`, `end_col`, and `region`. They don't do anything right now, just don't use them for anything not obvious.
- A linter can report errors coming from multiple files. Thanks @mheinzler (#1528) ðŸš€!


Finally, a house keeping notice:
A year has passed, and we will begin to remove deprecated code.
Look for deprecation warnings in the Sublime Text console.
If you find any, let the plugin author know (or open a PR to fix it of course ðŸ˜‰)!
