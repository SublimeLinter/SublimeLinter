SublimeLinter 4.12
==================

- Improved errors tooltip:
  Now wraps long lines
  Easily copy the error messages to you clipboard thanks to @kylebebak 💐

- Deprecations:
  We've previously pushed a number of deprecation warnings,
  those deprecations are now in full effect. Some new warnings
  (mostly for features you shouldn't be using anyway) have been
  added. Background info for plugin developers can be found
  here: https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/pull/1613
