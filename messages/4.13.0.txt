SublimeLinter 4.13
==================

- @mheinzler continued his work on multi-file-linters: linters that
  follow imports or report errors from multiple files in one go. 

  Plugin authors interested in this feature should capture and report 
  `filename`, either automatically using a named group in their regex,
  or manually when yielding a `LintMatch`.

- @HusamIbrahim rewrote the executable lookup algorithm for `NodeLinter`. 
  We now support eslint v6, the new yarn pnp mode, lerna.

  * You need yarn v1.8 or even yarn berry for pnp mode.
    Thanks to @arcanis who is the tech lead of yarn for
    answering our questions and quickly merging a PR. 

- The setting 'kill_old_processes' now defaults to `True`. The setting 
  controls whether SublimeLinter actively kills processes whose results
  are already outdated, e.g. because the view changed in the meantime. 

  This should save CPU time and battery. We've been testing this for a
  while and there doesn't seem to be a negative impact, so it's time to
  flip the switch.
