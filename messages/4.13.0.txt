SublimeLinter 4.13
==================

- @mheinzler continued his work on multi-file-linters, t.i. linters which e.g.
  follow imports or generally report errors from multiple files in one go. 

  Plugin authors interested in this feature should capture and report 
  `filename`, either automatically using a named group in their regex, or 
  manually when yielding `LintMatch`es.


- @HusamIbrahim rewrote the executable lookup algorithm for `NodeLinter`s. 
  We now support eslint v6, the new yarn pnp mode*, lerna.

  * With yarn pnp we basically support the future because you need yarn v1.8
  or even yarn berry.  Thanks to @arcanis who is the tech lead of yarn for
  answering our questions and quickly merging a PR against their code base. 


- The setting 'kill_old_processes' now defaults to `True`.  The setting 
  controls whether SublimeLinter actively kills processes whose results are already outdated, usually because the view changed in the meantime. 

  This generally makes sense and saves CPU time and battery, and since we
  didn't get any negative feedback it's time to flip the switch for all.
