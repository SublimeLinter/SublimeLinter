SublimeLinter 4.16 - Quick Actions (beta)

We're building a new feature to quickly ignore specific error messages.
At first we will ship actions for eslint, stylelint, flake8, mypy and phpcs.

Want to see actions for your favourite linter?
Please open an issue so we can investigate it.

Eventually this will become an API so that plugins can add their own.
