SublimeLinter 4.22.0


--- @mataha improved our Yarn support drastically (#1899).

--- There is a new setting `"highlights.start_hidden": ["phantoms"],`.
    (I actually promised this for 4.20.0 but it wasn't there yet.)

    Use this to hide possible drawn inline phantoms initially, and then toggle
    them when needed.  Really like you might do with the error panel, but then
    with the error details inlined.

    You might try a key-binding for fast toggling:

    ```
    { "keys": ["ctrl+k", "ctrl+k"],
      "command": "sublime_linter_toggle_highlights",
      "args": {"what": ["phantoms"]}
    },
    ```

--- Implement `disable_if_not_dependency` for Python based linters, useful
    if you don't want to use globally installed binaries.
