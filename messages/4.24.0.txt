SublimeLinter 4.24.0

That's it: we say Goodbye to Sublime Text 3 and run on the Python 3.8 host.
You may want to restart.

How is this implemented?  On Sublime's startup and when you install/remove
packages using Package Control we automatically lift all SL adapters/addons
to the 3.8 host.  This is necessary as it is impossible to get cooperation
in a single step and limited timeline for 100+ repos.  Over time these helper
packages may eventually update and Sublime Linter will remove the "lifts".

During that period it may or may not be necessary to restart Sublime Text
after upgrades of such plugins.  This is currently unknown as I (and we) don't
have much experience in these processes.  This is a novel approach after all.
That being said, on my machine installing and uninstalling is seamless and
just works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.


Sincerely,
