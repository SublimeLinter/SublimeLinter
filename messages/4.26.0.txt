SublimeLinter 4.26.0

BREAKING CHANGE:  TL;DR - By default, only whole files are linted from now on.

SublimeLinter was always capable of linting just parts of a view if the whole
file did not match a given "selector".  E.g. it could lint code blocks inside
markdown documents.  There was no way to opt-out of this behavior, except
maybe to use the `excludes` setting to exclude all `*.md` files, although most
linters don't have a good understanding of such sub-blocks -- let's call them
cells, as in: notebook cells.

v4.26.0 introduces a new setting `enable_cells` which defaults to `False`
(which makes it a breaking change).  Plugin authors can opt-in in their
plugin, so can users, on a case-by-case basis.

E.g. you could still let `flake8` run on python blocks in your docs if
you want to but then probably also configure per-file overrides, e.g. to only
report whitespace errors or to exclude any unused-var warnings, etc for them.
