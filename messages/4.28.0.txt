SublimeLinter 4.28.0
====================

SublimeLinter always had lint modes like "background" or "load_save" which
*describe* on which circumstances a linter may run but are relatively
coarse-grained.  We now allow a list here with the modes "on_save", "on_load",
"on_modified" which can be combined as the user wishes.
Refer https://www.sublimelinter.com/en/master/linter_settings.html#lint-mode
for more details.

The command `sublime_linter_lint` learned a new arg `run` which specifies
which linter(s) you want to run.  Previously, always all valid linters for a
view did run.  This new arg is also used as an optimization when reloading the
config or a linter class.
We also expose the related function `hit` to trigger linter runs programmatically.

for any LSP server.
