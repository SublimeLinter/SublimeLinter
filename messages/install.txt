Welcome to SublimeLinter, a linter framework for Sublime Text 3.

                 * * * IMPORTANT! * * *

        Linters *NOT* included with SublimeLinter 3,
        they must be installed separately.

                * * * READ THE DOCS! * * *

Otherwise you will never know how to install linters, nor will
you know about all of the great new features in SublimeLinter 3.

easy to update, easy to extend. If you use SublimeLinter and feel
