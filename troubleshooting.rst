Troubleshooting
===============
|sl| is a complex beast, and because it tries to tie together |st|, a linter plugin, and a linter binary, there are plenty of places for things to go wrong.


Console output
--------------
If |sl| detects an error during its operation, it prints a (hopefully) useful message to the |st| console. To open the console, press :kbd:`Control+\``. Error messages will be prefixed with :samp:`SublimeLinter: WARNING:` or :samp:`SublimeLinter: ERROR:`.

This will cover most errors, but if the linter executable itself generates an internal error, SublimeLinter cannot detect that. To see error messages generated by an executable, you will have to turn debug mode on.


.. _debug-mode:

Debug mode
----------
If you are having trouble installing or configuring SublimeLinter, or it doesn’t seem to be working, and none of the error messages in the console are indicating why, you can turn on **debug mode**. In debug mode, SublimeLinter prints copious amounts of information about what is happening internally to the |st| console.

To turn on debug mode, follow these steps:

#. Click on ``Tools > SublimeLinter`` in the main menu bar.

#. At the bottom of the ``SublimeLinter`` menu, you will see a ``Debug Mode`` item. If it is unchecked, select the item.

#. Restart |st|.

#. Press :kbd:`Control+\`` to open the |st| console.

#. Look for messages that begin with :samp:`SublimeLinter:`, especially ones that begin with :samp:`SublimeLinter: WARNING:` or :samp:`SublimeLinter: ERROR:`.

#. Go to the |_group| and report the problem along with any :samp:`SublimeLinter:` console output.

Among the information dumped to the console in debug mode:

- The |path| detected from your system plus whatever you put in the :ref:`"paths" global setting <paths-setting>`, used to locate executables.

- If python 3 is on your system, ``sys.path`` for that python.

- Success or failure of module importing by python-based linter plugins.

- The command line used to execute a linter.

- The output from the linter, including both linting reports and internal linter errors.


The linter doesn’t work!
-------------------------
The first thing you should do when a linter does not work within |sl| is to test it from the command line (Terminal in Mac OS X/Linux, Command Prompt in Windows). If it does not work from the command line, it definitely won’t work in |sl|.

Here are the most common reasons why a linter does not work:

- The linter binary is not installed. In that case the linter plugin will print a warning to the |st| console like this:

  .. code-block:: none

     SublimeLinter: WARNING: jshint deactivated, cannot locate 'jshint'

  Be sure to install the linter as documented in the linter plugin’s README.

- The linter binary is installed (as verified from the command line), but its path is not available to |sl|. In that case you will see a warning message like the one above for a missing linter binary. Follow the steps in :ref:`debugging-path-problems` below to ensure the binary’s path is available to |sl|.

- The linter binary is installed, but it does not fulfill the plugin’s version requirements. In that case |sl| will print a warning to the |st| console like this:

  .. code-block:: none

     SublimeLinter: WARNING: jshint deactivated, version requirement (>= 2.5.0) not fulfilled by 2.4.3

  In most cases this means you have an old version of the linter binary installed. Upgrading to the latest version should fix the problem.

- A python-based linter binary is installed, but it does not work with python 2 or python 3 code. In that case, follow the steps in :ref:`debugging-python-based-linters` below.


Use the group, Luke
-------------------
Please do **not** open a ticket on Github issues until you have verified there isn't already a ticket in the |_group| or the now deprecated `SublimeLinter google group`_.

Once you are confident the problem is solved, you can turn debug mode off using the steps above to uncheck the ``Debug Mode`` menu item.

.. _SublimeLinter google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sublimelinter

----

.. _debugging-path-problems:

Debugging PATH problems
-----------------------
In order for |sl| to use linter executables, it must be able to find them on your system. There are two possible sources for executable path information:

#. The |path| environment variable.

#. The :ref:`"paths" <paths-setting>` global setting.

At startup |sl| queries the system to get your |path| and merges that with paths in the :ref:`"paths" <paths-setting>` setting. In :ref:`debug mode <debug-mode>` |sl| prints the computed path to the console under the heading ``SublimeLinter: computed PATH <source>:``. You can use that information to help you determine why a linter executable cannot be found.

If a linter’s executable cannot be found when the linter plugin is loaded, the plugin is disabled and you will see a message like this in the console:

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: WARNING: jshint deactivated, cannot locate 'jshint'

On the other hand, if the linter plugin’s executable can be found at load time, but later on it becomes unavailable, when you try to use that linter you will see a message like this in the console:

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: ERROR: could not launch ['/usr/local/bin/jshint', '--verbose', '-']
    SublimeLinter: reason: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/bin/jshint'
    SublimeLinter: PATH: <your PATH here>

Another possibility is that an executable called by the linter executable is missing. For example, if `jshint`_ is available but `node`_ is not, you would see something like this in the console:

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: jshint output:
    env: node: No such file or directory

.. note::

   On Windows, linter errors messages will not always appear. It appears to be a bug in python.

Unlike the other error messages mentioned earlier, you would not see this message unless debug mode was turned on, because it isn’t an error message detected by |sl|, it is the output captured from the `jshint`_ executable. So if you aren’t seeing any errors or warnings in the console and the linter isn’t working, turn on debug mode to see if you can find the source of the problem.


Finding a linter executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If |sl| says it cannot find a linter executable, there are several steps you should take to locate the source of the problem.

First you need to see if the linter executable is in your |path|. Enter the following at a command prompt, replacing ``linter`` with the linter executable name:

.. code-block:: none

    # Mac OS X, Linux
    hash -r
    which linter

    # Windows
    where linter

If the result says that the linter could not be found, that means the linter executable is in a directory which is not in your |path|, and |sl| will not be able to find it. At this point you will have to find out what directory the executable was installed in from the linter’s documentation. Once you find that, you will need to augment your |path| by following the steps in :ref:`Augmenting PATH <augmenting-path>` below.

If the result of ``which`` displays a path, this means the executable is in your |path|, but you are on Mac OS X or Linux and the path to the executable is exported in a shell startup file that |sl| does not read. This means you must add the parent directory of the executable to your |path| by following the steps in :ref:`Augmenting PATH <augmenting-path>` below.


.. _augmenting-path:

Augmenting PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the path to an executable’s parent directory is not available to |sl|, you have two choices:

#. Add the path to the :ref:`"paths" <paths-setting>` global setting.

#. On Mac OS X or Linux, adjust your shell startup files. On Windows, add the directory to your |path| environment variable.

.. note::

   Paths in the :ref:`"paths" <paths-setting>` setting will be searched before system paths.


Adding to the "paths" setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This approach is the quickest and usually the easiest, but means that you will have to maintain paths both in your system and in |sl|. In addition, it isn’t always obvious what path to add without consulting the documentation for software you install.

Once you determine a path that needs to be added, :ref:`open your user settings <opening-user-settings>` and add the path to the ``"paths"`` array for your platform. For example, let’s say you are using `rbenv`_ on Mac OS X, which adds the path :file:`~/.rbenv/shims` to your |path|. You would change the ``"paths"`` setting like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "paths": {
            "linux": [],
            "osx": [
                "~/.rbenv/shims"
            ],
            "windows": []
        }
    }


Adjusting shell startup files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This approach is a little more complicated, but once you get it right then your |path| will be correct for command line usage and for |sl|.

All shells read various files when they are run. Depending on the command line arguments, shells read a “profile/env” file of some sort and an “rc” (runtime configuration) file. For example, ``bash`` reads :file:`.bash_profile` and :file:`.bashrc` (among others) and ``zsh`` reads :file:`.zshenv` and/or :file:`.zprofile` (depending on the platform) and :file:`.zshrc` (among others).

If you aren’t sure what shell you are using, type this in a terminal:

.. code-block:: none

    echo $SHELL

When |sl| starts up, it runs your shell as a **login shell** to get the |path|. This forces the shell to read the “profile/env” file, but for most shells the “rc” file is not read. There is a very good reason for this: performing initialization that only relates to interactive shells is not only wasteful, it will in many cases fail if there is no terminal attached to the process. By the same token, you should avoid putting code in the “profile/env” file that has any output (such as ``motd`` or ``fortune``), since that only works with interactive shells attached to a terminal.

The list of shells supported by |sl| and the startup file that must contain |path| augmentations is shown in this table:

+----------------+----------------------------+
| Shell          | File                       |
+================+============================+
| bash           | ~/.bash_profile            |
+----------------+----------------------------+
| zsh (Mac OS X) | ~/.zprofile                |
+----------------+----------------------------+
| zsh (Linux)    | ~/.zshenv or ~/.zprofile   |
+----------------+----------------------------+
| fish           | ~/.config/fish/config.fish |
+----------------+----------------------------+

If you are using ``zsh`` on Linux, you need to determine which file is used in your flavor of Linux. To do so, follow these steps:

#. Open :file:`.zshenv` in an editor and insert ``echo env`` on the first line. If the file does not exist, create it.

#. Do the same for :file:`.zprofile`, but insert ``echo profile``.

#. In a terminal, enter ``$SHELL -l -c 'echo hello'``. If you see both “env” and “profile”, use :file:`.zshenv` for |path| augmentations. If you see only one of the two, use that file for |path| augmentations.

#. Remove or comment out the ``echo`` lines you added.

----

When you installed a linter executable, it may have augmented your |path| in the “rc” file. But for these path augmentations to be visible to |sl|, you must move such augmentations to the “profile/env” file. For example, if you are using ``bash`` as your shell and you installed `rbenv`_, you would probably find this in your :file:`.bashrc` file:

.. code-block:: none

    eval "$(rbenv init -)"

For |sl| to “see” this, however, you have to move that line from :file:`.bashrc` to the file that |sl| will see, which is :file:`.bash_profile` from the table above.

If ``which`` or ``where`` cannot find a linter executable from the command line, you need to add the executable’s parent directory to your |path|. Assuming a directory of :file:`/opt/bin`, on Mac OS X or Linux the changes you would make are summarized in the following table:

+----------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Shell          | File                       | Code                              |
+================+============================+===================================+
| bash           | ~/.bash_profile            | export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH        |
+----------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| zsh (Mac OS X) | ~/.zprofile                | export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH        |
+----------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| zsh (Linux)    | ~/.zshenv or ~/.zprofile   | export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH        |
+----------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| fish           | ~/.config/fish/config.fish | set PATH /opt/bin $PATH           |
+----------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+


Special considerations for ``bash``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are using ``bash`` as your shell, there is one more step you must take after augmenting your |path| in :file:`.bash_profile`.

- On Mac OS X, add this code to the **bottom** of :file:`.bash_profile`:

  .. code-block:: none

    case $- in
       *i*) source ~/.bashrc
    esac

  On Mac OS X, ``bash`` does **not** load :file:`.bashrc` unless explicitly run with the ``-i`` command line argument. On the other hand, :file:`.bash_profile` is loaded in each new interactive Terminal session and if ``bash`` is run as a login shell. So you must load :file:`.bashrc` in :file:`.bash_profile`, but should only do so if the shell is interactive, which is what the code above does.

- On Linux, add this code to the **top** of :file:`.bashrc`:

  .. code-block:: none

    source ~/.bash_profile

  On Linux, by default ``bash`` does **not** load :file:`.bash_profile` for an interactive session, but it does for a login shell. So if you move your |path| augmentations to :file:`.bash_profile` and source that in :file:`.bashrc`, your |path| augmentations will always be loaded.


Editing |path| on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On Windows you need to edit your |path| environment variable directly. The easiest way to do this is with the `Path Editor`_, a free application. Once you install and launch Path Editor, follow these steps:

#. Click the Add button.

#. Select the parent directory of the linter executable and click OK.

#. Click OK at the bottom of the Path Editor window.

On any platform, after you have changed your |path|, you will need to restart |st|.


Validating your PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To verify that |sl| will be able to see the changes you made above, enter the following at a command prompt, replacing “linter” with the name of the linter executable which could not be found:

.. code-block:: none

    # Mac OS X, Linux
    > $SHELL -l -c '/usr/bin/which linter'

    # Windows
    > where linter

If your changes were correct, it will print the path to the linter executable. If the executable path is not printed, then do the following to see what |path| |sl| will see:

.. code-block:: none

    # bash, zsh
    > $SHELL -l -c 'echo $PATH | tr : "\n"'

    # fish
    > fish -l -c 'for p in $PATH; echo $p; end'

    # Windows
    > path

At this point you should double-check that you followed the instructions above correctly, and if you still cannot figure out what is going wrong, post a message on the |_group|. Be sure to outline the steps you took and include the contents of your shell startup file.


.. _debugging-python-based-linters:

Debugging python-based linters
------------------------------
When using python-based linters, there are more possibilities for configuration problems:

- The version of python or the python script specified in the linter plugin may not be available.

- The version of python you specify for your source code with the :ref:`@python meta setting <python-meta-setting>` or a :ref:`shebang <shebangs>` may not be available.

- The specified version of python may be available, but the linter module for that version may not be installed.

To understand how these might occur, it’s important to understand :ref:`how SublimeLinter resolves python versions <resolving-python-versions>`. Let’s look at the console output for each case to see how to spot these problems.


Linter’s python is not available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a python-based linter plugin is loaded that does not support direct execution (the ``module`` attribute is ``None``), if the ``cmd`` attribute specifies ``script@python<version>``, where ``script`` is a python script such as ``flake8``, and ``<version>`` is a major[.minor] version, |sl| attempts to :ref:`locate a version of python <resolving-python-versions>` that satisfies ``<version>``.

If no version of python can be found that satisfies the requested version, the linter plugin is disabled, and you will see the following message in the console (where “foo” is the linter name):

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: WARNING: foo deactivated, no available version of python or foo satisfies foo@python2


Setting python is not available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the linter plugin does **not** specify a python version in the ``cmd`` attribute (e.g. ``flake8@python``), then |sl| will tentatively enable the linter when it is loaded, even if no default python can be found, because the requested python version may change based on your settings.

For example, if there were no default version of python available for `flake8`_, you would see this in the console at startup:

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: flake8 activated: (None, None)

Now if you tried to use the `flake8`_ linter with code that did not have a specific python version set with the :ref:`@python meta setting <python-meta-setting>`, :ref:`inline setting <inline-settings>` or :ref:`shebang <shebangs>`, you would see this error in the console:

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: ERROR: flake8 cannot locate 'flake8@python'


Module not installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the other hand, if ``python2`` is available and you have a ``@python: 2`` meta or inline setting, **but** you do not have `flake8`_ installed for python 2, you would see something like this in the console:

.. code-block:: none

    SublimeLinter: flake8: test.py ['/usr/bin/python2', '/usr/local/bin/flake8', '--max-complexity=-1', '-']
    SublimeLinter: flake8 output:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/local/bin/flake8", line 5, in <module>
        from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
      File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 2556, in <module>
        working_set.require(__requires__)
      File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 620, in require
        needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
      File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 518, in resolve
        raise DistributionNotFound(req)  # XXX put more info here
    pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: flake8==2.1.0


Some good advice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To ensure your python linters work well, always ensure:

- The versions of python you code in are available in your |path|.

- You install the linter module (using `easy_install`_ or `pip`_) for all versions of python you plan to use it with.

If you do that, you shouldn’t have any problems. But if you do, hopefully the troubleshooting guide above will help you understand what is wrong with your system configuration.
